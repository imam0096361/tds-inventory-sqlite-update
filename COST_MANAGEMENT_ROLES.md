##  **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Backend Protection:**
```javascript
// VIEW Permission (all finance roles)
GET /api/financial/summary         → finance_viewer ✅
GET /api/maintenance-costs          → finance_viewer ✅
GET /api/budgets                   → finance_viewer ✅

// EDIT Permission (manager/admin only)
POST /api/maintenance-costs         → finance_viewer ❌
PUT /api/budgets/:id               → finance_viewer ❌
DELETE /api/maintenance-costs/:id   → finance_viewer ❌
```

**Middleware:**
- `canViewCost` - Allows: admin, finance, finance_manager, finance_viewer
- `canEditCost` - Allows: admin, finance, finance_manager ONLY

### **Frontend Protection:**
```typescript
const canEdit = user?.role === 'admin' || 
                user?.role === 'finance' || 
                user?.role === 'finance_manager';

// finance_viewer gets canEdit = false
```

**UI Changes:**
- Hides "Add" buttons if `!canEdit`
- Hides "Delete" buttons if `!canEdit`
- Shows "View Only" badge if `!canEdit`

---

## 🎯 **HOW TO ASSIGN ROLES**

### **Option 1: Via User Management (Admin Panel)**

1. Login as **admin**
2. Go to **User Management**
3. Click "Add New User" or Edit existing user
4. Select Role:
   - `user` - Regular user (no Cost Management access)
   - `finance_viewer` - Read-only financial access
   - `finance_manager` - Full Cost Management access
   - `admin` - Full system access
5. Save

### **Option 2: Via Database (Direct)**

UPDATE users 
SET role = 'finance_manager' 
WHERE username = 'john_doe';

-- Make a user finance_viewer
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'finance_viewer' 
WHERE username = 'jane_smith';

SET role = 'user' 
WHERE username = 'bob_jones';
```
