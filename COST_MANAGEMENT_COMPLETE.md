**Commit:** `40dfd11`  
**Status:** LIVE on production

**Issue Fixed:**
```
❌ Port conflict: Backend and frontend both trying to use port 3001
❌ This caused: "EADDRINUSE" error
❌ Result: Backend couldn't start, frontend got fetch errors
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Changed backend port from 3001 to 5000
✅ server-postgres.cjs: const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
✅ Frontend already configured for port 5000
✅ No conflicts now!
```

**Current Configuration:**
```
Frontend (Vite):  http://localhost:3000 or 3001 (auto-select)
Backend (Express): http://localhost:5000
API Calls:        http://localhost:5000/api/*
