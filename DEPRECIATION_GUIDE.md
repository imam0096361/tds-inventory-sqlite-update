# 📉 **DEPRECIATION GUIDE**
**Simple Guide for CEO & IT Head**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT IS DEPRECIATION?**
**Think of it like a car:** When you buy a car for $20,000, it loses value every year. After 5 years, it's worth less (maybe $5,000). That's **depreciation**.

In IT, your computers, laptops, and servers lose value over time. **Depreciation** tracks how much value they've lost.

---

## 🔍 **WHY DO WE NEED THIS?**
1. **📊 Financial Reporting:** Know the true value of your IT assets
2. **📈 Tax Deductions:** Reduce your taxable income
3. **🔮 Budget Planning:** Plan for future replacements
4. **📉 Asset Valuation:** Show accurate company balance sheets

---

## 📝 **HOW TO USE DEPRECIATION**

### **STEP 1: Add Cost Information to Assets**
When adding or editing PCs, Laptops, or Servers, you'll now see:
**💰 Cost Information (Optional)** section

**Fill in:**
- **Purchase Cost:** How much you paid (e.g., 50,000৳)
- **Purchase Date:** When you bought it (e.g., 2023-01-15)
- **Warranty End Date:** When warranty expires
- **Supplier:** Vendor name
- **Depreciation Years:** Auto-set (PC:5, Laptop:3, Server:7)

---

### **STEP 2: View Depreciation Report**
1. Go to **Cost Management**
2. Click **"Depreciation"** tab
3. See the report showing:
   - Current value of each asset
   - How much value lost

## 📊 **DEPRECIATION RULES**

### **📉 Depreciation Periods:**
| Asset Type | Years | Why? |
|------------|-------|------|
| **PCs** | 5 years | Standard office computers |
| **Laptops** | 3 years | Mobile devices age faster |
| **Servers** | 7 years | Enterprise hardware lasts longer |

## 🧮 **HOW IT CALCULATES**

### **Example 1: PC**
```
Purchase: $50,000 on 2020-01-01
Depreciation Period: 5 years
Age: 4 years

Annual Depreciation = $50,000 ÷ 5 = $10,000/year
Total Depreciation = $10,000 × 4 years = $40,000
Current Value = $50,000 - $40,000 = $10,000

Result: Your $50,000 PC is now worth $10,000
```

### **Example 2: Laptop**
```
Purchase: $80,000 on 2024-06-01
Depreciation Period: 3 years
Age: 0.5 years

Annual Depreciation = $80,000 ÷ 3 = $26,667/year
Total Depreciation = $26,667 × 0.5 years = $13,333
Current Value = $80,000 - $13,333 = $66,667

Result: Your $80,000 laptop is now worth $66,667
```
