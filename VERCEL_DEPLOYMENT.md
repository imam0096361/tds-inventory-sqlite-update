## 🔄 Latest Update

**🎉 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED** - October 24, 2025

**Issue Identified**: All frontend pages were hardcoded to use `http://localhost:3001` for API calls, causing database connection failures on other PCs.

**Solution**: Replaced all absolute localhost URLs with relative paths (`/api/...`), allowing Vercel to handle API requests properly.

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Fixed API URLs in all 7 frontend pages (PCInfo, LaptopInfo, ServerInfo, Dashboard, PeripheralLog, KeyboardLog, SSDLog)
- ✅ Added health check endpoint at `/api/health` for real-time database connectivity verification
- ✅ Verified database connection with correct PostgreSQL credentials

**Connection String**: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_VWYJCfilwL47@ep-lively-cloud-a1lfo3j0-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`

This deployment ensures the application works consistently across **all devices and platforms** with a fully functional cloud database.
