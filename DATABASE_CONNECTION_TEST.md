# 🔍 Database Connection Test

## ✅ Health Check Endpoint Added!

A new health check endpoint has been added to verify database connectivity in real-time.

---

## 📋 How to Test

### **1️⃣ Wait for Vercel Deployment (2-3 minutes)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: `tds-inventory-sqlite-update`
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Wait until the latest deployment shows **"Ready"** ✅

---

### **2️⃣ Test the Health Check Endpoint**

#### **On Your PC (Local):**
Open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "database": "Connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T...",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

#### **On Vercel (Production):**
Open your browser and visit:
```
https://tds-inventory-sqlite-update.vercel.app/api/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "database": "Connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### **3️⃣ Test on Other PC**

On the other PC where the database is not working:

1. **Open browser**
2. **Visit**: `https://tds-inventory-sqlite-update.vercel.app/api/health`
3. **Check the response**:
   - ✅ **If "status": "OK"** - Database is connected! The issue might be in the frontend.
   - ❌ **If "status": "ERROR"** - Database is not connected. We need to fix Vercel environment variables.

---

## 🚨 If You See an Error

If the health check shows `"status": "ERROR"`, copy the **entire error message** and send it to me.

Example error:
```json
{
  "status": "ERROR",
  "database": "Disconnected",
  "error": "connection timeout",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## 📝 What to Report Back

Please test the health check and tell me:
1. **Local PC**: Does `/api/health` show "OK"? ✅ or ❌
2. **Vercel (Your PC)**: Does `/api/health` show "OK"? ✅ or ❌
3. **Vercel (Other PC)**: Does `/api/health` show "OK"? ✅ or ❌

This will help us pinpoint exactly where the connection is failing!
